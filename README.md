# ParkEase - Smart Parking System

## Introduction
ParkEase is a smart, web-based platform designed to simplify the parking experience. It serves as a bridge between drivers looking for convenient parking spots and property owners (vendors) who want to monetize their unused space.

The system features a user-friendly interface for:
- **Drivers**: To effortlessly search for parking spots on a map, view details, and book slots in real-time.
- **Vendors**: To list their parking locations, manage availability, and track earnings.
- **Administrators**: To oversee the entire ecosystem, ensuring quality and security by approving listings and managing users.

By digitizing the parking process, ParkEase reduces the hassle of finding parking, saves time, and provides a secure tracking system for all transactions.
